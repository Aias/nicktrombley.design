On top of his normal high quality design work, he proactively helped code and design internal tools (one of which was so successful and helpful that Epic opened it up to customers too). His knowledge of data visualization principles and techniques were of constant help, and the various educational design presentations he made to hundreds of our staff (including both designers and non-designers) were some of their favorites. Nick would be a strong asset to any user-centered team.",

As he worked with his teams to find the best solution, he would take the time to explain why he favored one choice over another. He invites conversation about his decisions and does well with critique. He delivered multiple talks at Epic that were philosophical in nature - a potentially dangerous area when talking to a room of hundreds of skeptical software engineers. His talks were met by high ratings, and the highest honor: being quoted between engineers later that week. Nick understands that design decisions do not exist in a vacuum and that great solutions come from iterative, inclusive work.",
