I am a web designer and developer with over 5 years' experience, previously at Epic Systems, a large healthcare IT company in Wisconsin. My strengths lie in bridging the gap between design and development – I am a strong believer in the design-build methodology, popular in architecture but sadly not so much for digital constructions. What this means is that I find the most successful products are ones where the architect is the builder is (in the best case) the end user.

Most of the work I did at Epic is unfortunately not public domain, and I am unable to share detailed images or descriptions here. That said, there's a high likelihood that if there's a problem you're trying to solve, there's at least one project under my belt that's probably related. I've worked with designers and developers on everything from user research to design systems to data visualization and back again, and I'm happy to talk about the specifics of those projects on a less public platform – say, Skype or WebEx. 

For public examples of my work, see:

My portfolio and professional site.

- https://barnsworthburning.net/
A commonplace book which collects important things I read and want to remember.

- https://the-innocent-i.net/
My personal website / blog. (In progress)

All of the sites listed above I have designed and built from the ground up, with the goal of creating sites that are quick to load and respond, usable on all sizes and shapes of screens, and, hopefully, nice to look at too.

If you're creating products for the web, whether that's an enterprise application with thousands of users, or a small site with a more personal touch, I believe I can help. Contact me at trombley.nick@gmail.com or 518.572.7310, and I'll convince you.


Best,
Nick
