		These pages outline the professional experience of
		<strong>Nick Trombley</strong>, a web designer / developer based in New
		York.
	</p>
	<p>
		Whether I am designing enterprise-grade tools and applications, or
		developing small sites with a personal touch, I care about bringing to
		my work a sense of craft, purpose, and – on the good days – beauty.
	</p>
	<p>
		I am
		<strong>available for hire</strong>.

		If you’re deciding whether to hire me, my
		<a href="/files/trombley_resume.pdf">resumé</a> would be a good start.
		The bulk of my work has been done at Epic Systems, where I was on the UX
		design team for about five years.
	</p>
	<p>
		For an idea of where my talents lie, I maintain a running
		<a href="/projects">projects list</a>. (List-ish. List-esque.)

		something interesting and have the time to record it.
