		These pages represent the professional experience of
		<strong>Nick Trombley</strong>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Elevator pitch: <strong>I make things for the web</strong>. Whether that
		means designing enterprise-grade tools and applications, or developing
		small sites with a personal touch, I care about bringing to my work a
		sense of craft, purpose, and – on the good days – beauty.
	</p>
	<p>
		I currently live in New York, and am
		<strong>available for hire</strong>.

		If you’re deciding whether you want to hire me, you should start with my
		<a href="/files/trombley_resume.pdf">resumé</a>. I worked at Epic
		Systems for about 6 years, most of which as a UX designer / developer.
	</p>
	<p>
		For an idea of the kinds of things I’ve done over the years, check out
		the <a href="/projects">projects list</a>. (List-ish. List-esque.)

		At <a href="https://barnsworthburning.net">barnsworthburning</a> I keep
		my commonplace book and idea repository, updated whenever I read
		something interesting and have the time to record it.

	<p>
		And there’s <a href="https://the-innocent-i.net">the-innocent-i</a>,
		where you might find incomplete thoughts, experiments in design and
		code, and other oddities.
