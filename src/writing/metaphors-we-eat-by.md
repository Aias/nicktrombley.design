For a long time I've been obsessed with the idea of metaphor as a tool for teaching and understanding. *Metaphors We Eat By* was originally going to be titled *Metaphors We Learn By* (inspired by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson's classic *[Metaphors We Live By][metaphors]*), and I had plans to relate lessons on good design from a bunch of different fields, from [music][music] to [metallurgy][metal]. But it quickly became too ambitious and too meandering for a targeted 45-minute talk. Instead I decided to focus on just one other field that I think web design can learn from – cooking. [Samin Nosrat][samin] is a natural teacher, and I believe that her framework for learning the essentials of good cooking could be applied almost universally to other creative fields.

The focus here is specifically on *visual design*, which is just one aspect of good software or web design, but still so essential, and still so often done poorly.

I gave this talk at [Epic][epic] to a group of about 200 developers, designers, and scattered other roles for [World Usability Day 2018][wud]. It's aimed at a junior audience, just starting to learn about design and UX. 

The script and slides are mostly unedited, so there may be parts that don't work as well in a different medium. Heads up: this is a long read.

![Title slide - metaphors we live by][1]

Hi everyone, and thanks for coming.

This talk is called metaphors we eat by. It was called metaphors we learn by, and then last week I basically rewrote the whole thing, and this is what was left.

I am not an artist, and I am not a chef. I’m a user experience designer, and I sometimes pretend to be a software developer, and if you asked me to paint you a picture, I haven’t moved much beyond the blobs and stick figures I started with when I was a kid. But today, I want to talk to you about a question that’s been on my mind a lot recently, which is: how do we, here at Epic, create beautiful things? And beyond that, how can we make sure that the skills and sensibilities required to produce beautiful things are not just the domain of people with “designer” in their titles, but shared by everyone?

And right now, I can’t talk about visual design, and its pursuit of beauty, without also talking about cooking, and its pursuit of flavor.

![Why?][2]

Three immediate questions come to mind:

First, why beauty? Why should we care about making beautiful things at all? This is not a rhetorical question - it's not obvious why you should care. Especially when so many of the things that you're learning and are being discussed this week seem so much more urgent – after all, this is Joy to Use week, not Joy to Look At week. Why should we spend time discussing how something looks when we could be spending time on things that actually matter, like making it more usable? And I totally sympathize with this, but I also feel that in our consistent focus on designing for function, utility, and efficiency, we tend to overlook a very simple truth, which is that people like to look at nice things. All else being equal, people would rather use a beautiful product than an ugly one, and most people would rather have a nice meal prepared with care and attention than drink Soylent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Second, why metaphor? If I want to teach you about the foundations of great visual design, why not just talk about great visual design? Well, because I believe that we learn best through metaphor, and choosing the right metaphor for an idea can help reinforce both the idea and the metaphor itself. I think almost every talk I've given here has structured itself very firmly around metaphor. Last year here I gave a talk which used Dante’s Inferno as a metaphor for the nine circles of design hell. Earlier this year I talked at the all R&D meeting about hotels and houses as an analogy for delightful UX. I think that metaphor and analogy are the most effective ways of understanding new things.

And finally, why cooking? Why this particular metaphor? What does flavor have to do with beauty?

Well, because ultimately I believe it is not just a metaphor that works, but that it’s actually good, and that good cooking, and good flavor, as you get into it, has these very deep relationships to creating visual beauty. As an example of what I mean, consider..

![Alinea dessert plating][3]

This dessert course. This is one of the creations of Grant Achatz, whose three-Michelin-star restaurant is actually within driving distance. At Chicago's Alinea, what they are creating is not just food, it's modern art. And there’s a common pattern we see, in shows like Chef’s Table, or Iron Chef, or the great British baking show, or anything else, that so many professional chefs also have such a deep understanding of how to present their ideas beautifully. On iron chef, plating is a whole category on its own, because they recognize that it matters not just what the ideas are, but how they are presented. The relationship between cooking and beauty is even revealed in the words we use when we talk about it: think about how we would describe an art critic as having “great taste”.

![Jared Spool's thoughts on Chef's Table][4]

The scene from the last slide is from an episode of a Netflix show that I keep coming back to again and again: Chef’s Table. And for anyone who hasn’t seen Chef’s Table, it’s a four or five episode per season documentary series, where each episode profiles some big-name chef and talks about how they got to where they are, the amazing dishes they create, and most importantly, what cooking means to them. And even though I will probably never get to eat at these places, Chef’s Table still has a very real appeal as a designer, because it’s not really about the food at all, but about the craft. And there’s a lot in there that anyone, in any creative discipline, can learn from.

Jared Spool, a UX researcher and overall just kind of a design talking head, agrees here, and in one of his talks about the user experience of Disney, says:

> “The Netflix series Chef's Table is all about design. It should be mandatory viewing for every designer. Because it's about how these people in this other craft are using design principles that we understand at every step of creating these Michelin star restaurants.”

And he’s talking here about UX more generally of course, but I think in terms of focus on a particular sensory experience – that is, taste – high end cooking has a lot to tell us about UI, it’s just that the interface here is our mouths, not our eyes.

Mandatory viewing is a strong statement, but the show really is that good.

![Samin talking about the subtleties of salt][5]

But still, even though it’s very inspirational, Chef’s Table does at times lack the kind of practical advice that you might want if you were someone who was really trying to learn from it. And when it comes to cooking, the thing that most people look to in order to learn how to make better food, of course, is the cookbook. And cookbooks lead us to believe that if you can follow a recipe, you can create good food. If you can get the right ingredients together in these particular proportions, and combine them in this particular order, for this amount of time, you’ll be good to go.

Let me show you a clip that might change your mind on this point a bit.

So, given what we’ve just seen, what exactly could this mean?

![Unclear instructions][6]

Our own job, at times, may feel like this. Kind of an overwhelming array of choices and possibilities, decisions that seem arbitrary. Should this header be theme colored or black? Should it be a header at all, or maybe we should use a card to group these elements instead? How big do I make this image? We are amateur chefs standing in the grocery store trying to decide between 15 different salts.

![Introducing Samin Nosrat][7]

The woman in that clip is Samin Nosrat, a chef who got her start at a very famous restaurant in California called Chez Panisse, and has since authored a book called *Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat*. You may be familiar with the Netflix adaptation of the same name.

Unlike other cookbooks, hers is not one that focuses on recipes with precise measurements and step by step instructions. It’s more about experimentation, exploration, and understanding than it is about being good at following directions. And I think that this is really very similar to the process of design, because a recipe doesn’t mean anything without an understanding of why it works. If you have a recipe, or you have a mockup, or a design document, then you know how to make one thing. What we really want is to feel confident creating anything, and to know that we have to tools to adapt to new situations.

![The four elements of good cooking][8]

As the name would imply, Samin believes that just four simple elements — salt, fat, acid, and heat — form the basis of all good cooking, and if you can learn to understand these elements, and master their use, then anyone can learn to cook good food, without a recipe, and with whatever ingredients you happen to have on hand.

What is so important about Nosrat’s book and her show is not just that she’s telling us salt, fat, acid, and heat have important contributions to make to flavor. What’s important is that she’s found a way to articulate so well the different *roles* that salt, fat, acid, and heat play in contributing to the flavor of a dish: salt enhances flavor; fat carries flavor; acid balances flavor; heat transforms.

I think that these same four roles are foundational to any creative field, and if we think about it in this more abstract way, the only difference between cooking and designing is that we use a screen instead of a plate as our medium of expression.

![Eyes and mouths][9]

And so, just as chefs need to understand which of their ingredients enhance, carry, balance, and transform flavor, so do we as visual designers need to understand which elements of the medium we work with contribute to visual beauty, and in what way. And if Samin has discovered the four elements of cooking that map to these four roles, we should be able to discover equivalent elements which play these four roles in visual design.

![How to learn to cook well][10]

So that’s what I want to discover today. And I hope that in the process of thinking through what those four elements might be, that you learn something new about both good cooking and good design.

Jane Grigson was an English cooking writer, long-time food columnist for the Observer, and a respected teacher. She understood that good cooking started simply with an appreciation of good eating. Today, I hope to convince you of something similar – if you can appreciate a beautiful painting, or a well-designed book, or an engaging website, then you too can learn to design well.

![Fat][11]

The first element of good cooking is fat.

> Lorenzo: A lot of sommeliers hang around here, people who look for the scent in things. In our ham, they’ve smelled egg yolk, they’ve smelled chocolate, they’ve smelled walnuts, they’ve smelled acorns.
> Samin: How does the scent get there?
> Lorenzo: I don’t know! Maybe it sets in the fat.

![The foundation of flavor][12]

Fat is the second element that Samin mentions in her book, but it’s the first that she covers in the show, and for good reason. Fat is foundational to all good cooking. It is the medium through which flavor is transmitted in a dish, put it another way, it carries flavor more than any other element. If we think about almost any classic dish, we realize that fat is what makes that dish what it is: a croissant would be nothing without butter. Pesto would be nothing without olive oil.

So if we think about the design of our software, what element plays a similar foundational role? To answer that question, we first need to ask: If the goal of cooking is to create great flavor, what is it that we’re trying to create with a beautiful UI? Well, as opposed to a beautiful painting, which may aspire to be beautiful in itself, we have another aim in creating user interfaces here, which is not only to be a nice thing to look at, but also to give our users the information they need, to be understandable, and, above all else, to be meaningful.

And if we’re looking to convey visual meaning, of course there is one element which does the job better than any other: Typography. 

![Typography][13]

Type carries meaning in the same way that fat carries flavor. Letters form words, and words convey information. It also has the strongest associations with particular cultures, emotions, and styles, which is why it’s so important to make sure that type, as your base, reflects the spirit of your design. 

![Setting the bar][14]

The quality of the typography of a user interface also sets an upper bound on the quality of the whole product. Samin teaches us that “Food can only ever be as delicious as the fat with which it’s cooked.” And in the same way, a user interface can only ever be as beautiful as its typography. When I think of the most beautiful websites or apps that I use daily, one thing they have in common is beautiful typography. And in recent years we’ve seen a huge revolution in attention to typography from the biggest names in software design. Among others, Microsoft developed Segoe UI, Google developed Roboto, and Apple developed San Francisco.

![Jobs on typography][15]

Apple in particular has always known the foundational importance of type. Steve Jobs used to talk about this all the time in interviews and talks, how taking a calligraphy class in college that he thought he would never use eventually inspired him to pay attention to typography when he was working on the Macintosh. He talks about how the Mac was the first computer with proportionally spaced fonts, as opposed to monospace fonts, which contributes to readability and approachability. Think about what our software would be like, how it would be interpreted, if we replaced all of our fonts with Impact, or Comic Sans.

![Epic in Comic Sans][16]

Now that’s a UI for life-saving professionals!

But no, it just wouldn’t work, and not necessarily because Comic Sans or Impact are bad fonts per se, it’s just that they were meant for very different contexts. More than any other element, typography helps to convey the spirit or feeling of a design, because type has inherent relationships to attitudes, cultures, and eras. Comic Sans has childish or unserious qualities, and so it would feel out of place in the software we create. Instead, we’ve chosen Segoe because, among other reasons, it reads well on the windows machines our customers tend to use, it works at small sizes, it looks clean and modern, and it does not demand your attention unless it needs to.

![Choosing an olive oil][17]

It may be unclear how any of this affects your lives, considering most of us work on Hyperspace development, and Hyperspace uses Segoe UI, so it seems like all of these typographic decisions are already taken care of.

Though typefaces themselves might be the most visible artifact of typography, there's a lot more behind the curtain. You can think of Epic like an Italian restaurant – if it’s Italian, it means we primarily rely on olive oil. That decision is basically made for us. But that doesn’t solve the whole fat problem for us. Consider this photo I took at the grocery store yesterday. There are hundreds, or thousands or brands of olive oil out there, and even within the same brand, there are distinctions between virgin, extra virgin, refined, pomace, you name it.

Thinking that because we use Segoe UI means that we don’t need to pay attention to typography, is like thinking that we’ve chosen California Olive Ranch olive oil, and so that means we don’t have to worry about how to use it.

![Our typographic hierarchy][18]

This is our shelf of olive oils, but this does not represent the entirety of our typographic concerns.

As you dig into typography, you'll start to see that type is full of incredibly subtle distinctions and considerations, from ligatures to punctuation to formatting to alignment, and these all form the foundation of style, just as fat carries the essential flavors of a dish.

![Practical typography][19]

The good news is that, since the basics of typeface and hierarchy are already taken care of, that means we can mostly focus our attention on the details, and taking our use of type from good to great.

And going into these details would be a whole class in itself, but if you’re looking to learn more about it, I would highly recommend Matthew Butterick’s website and book, [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/). You’ll notice, if you start reading the topics and subtopics here, how few of the considerations of good typography actually have anything to do with the particular typeface or font what you’re using.

![Wrap-up: fat and typography][20]

So on your next design, remember: type carries information, and type is the foundation of beauty. A user interface can only ever be as beautiful as its typography.

![Salt][21]

The next of Samin’s four essential elements is salt. She tells us:

> “Salt is fundamental to all good cooking, and has a greater impact on flavor than any other ingredient. It enhances flavor, and even makes food taste more like itself. Learn to use it well, and your food will taste great.”

We often think of salt as something which has a flavor in itself, which is true, but it’s much more nuanced than that. When it’s included alongside the flavors of other ingredients, we find that its primary purpose is to bring the flavor of those ingredients to their fullest potential.

I think one of the most interesting lessons I ever learned about salt, and not even from salt, fat, acid, heat, is its role in counteracting bitterness. Next time you make pour-over coffee, add a pinch of salt on top of the grounds, and you’ll be amazed at the difference it makes. It won’t be salty, and it won’t be bitter, the coffee will just taste more like itself.

In visual design, what element do we use to enhance beauty?

I know what you’re thinking, and it’s not that.

![Space][22]

No, it’s Space.

Space, has a greater impact on beauty than any other element of design. On its own, it not much to look at (pun obviously intended), but when used in conjunction with other elements, it allows them to stand on their own, and it brings out their inherent beauty.

Probably the most important quality that space and salt have in common is this: you can almost always use more of them than you think.

![More than you think you need][23]

That’s Samin’s mom, literally spooning salt in huge scoops into the water that they’re going to use to cook rice. When I watched this I thought this was absolutely insane, especially since this is rice that they’re making, which is going to absorb a ton of that water, unlike something like pasta.

They go on later in the episode to taste that rice and both agree that it needed more salt. And I’m sure it tasted delicious.

![Apply liberally][24]

Samin believes that “the single most important element of good cooking is salt.” And I included that scene because it demonstrates the kind of visceral disbelief people have when they see how much of this element is required to really bring a dish to its full, flavorful potential. Space often acts the same way.

![Empty space, negative space][25]

On the design team we talk a lot about negative space, and how the empty areas of a screen can be as important as the ones that are filled. There’s a common reaction to emptiness that we see a lot here, where we think that any empty area of the screen is something to just begging to be filled in, even to the point of arbitrariness.

But like salt, I find that a design can almost always benefit from space. Almost inevitably, when I get a design to review, my first reaction is that it needs better spacing, and that almost always mean more of it, at every level.

![Alt][26]

If we want to learn more about effective use of both space and salt, there are few places we could look that would have more to say than Japan. In the episode on Salt, Samin visits a store in Japan which is 100% dedicated to selling different varieties of salt, and salt only. The man she talks to tells her that in Japan, they have over 4,000 varieties of salt. And salt is the key component of two quintessential Japanese condiments: soy sauce and miso, which are both basically fermented combinations of soy beans and salt.

![Six panels][27]

Japanese art has also historically made incredibly effective use of space. In this painting, you can see how 2 out of 6 panels are actually completely empty, and you might say, well that’s just a waste of panels! I bet those panels weren’t cheap, especially back then.

But really, it’s the attention to space which creates this almost hauntingly beautiful image.

![Great wave][28]

And it’s not surprising that Japan has developed such a close relationship to both salt and space, considering its position as an island nation, surrounded by the mother of all seasoning, and the most iconic earthly symbol of emptiness – the ocean. 

This might be the most famous Japanese artwork of all time, called the Great Wave. I can’t imagine feeling the need to fill that upper right hand corner with anything else.

![Layering and scale][29]

And these elements are important at both the largest and the smallest scales.

One of Samin’s anecdotes is about chef Judy Rodgers, who often told her cooks that a dish might need “seven more grains of salt.”

![Micro and macro space][30]

In designing our screens, we can start at the macro-level, adding space between big layout elements, and work out way down to the micro level, adjusting line heights and letter spacing.

And yeah, the version on the right is maybe 1/3 taller than the version on the left, by the improvement in readability is well worth the sacrifice.

Adjusting something like line height by only a pixel or two to get it just right for the text you have, is like chef Judy Rodgers telling her cooks that a dish might need just “seven more grains of salt.” Sometimes it really is that subtle, the difference between good and perfect. You may need to give a splash image 100 pixels of padding in any direction, or you might need just 2 pixels more space between a label and its value. The only way to know is to use your eyes, and adjust to taste.

![Wrap-up: salt and space][31]

As salt is fundamental to good cooking, space is fundamental to good design.

![Acid][32]

When we talk about good cooking, we often use the term “mouth watering” to describe delicious food. And the number one contributor to the sensation of mouth-watering-ness is acid. It literally makes our mouths water, because when we eat something sour, our mouths flood with saliva to counterbalance the acid, which is bad for our teeth. The more acidic a food is, the more our mouths water.

But of course, acidity needs to be used wisely. In most cases, it’s best when a dish doesn’t immediately jump out as you as acidic. Nobody wants to eat sour chicken parm, but two of the most important parts of that dish — the parmesan cheese and the tomato sauce — are full of acidity. It’s just that the acidity is perfectly balanced with the other ingredients of the dish.

Samin tells us that this is the most important role that acid can play. “Acid brightens food and creates contrast. And it does the absolutely indispensable job of *balancing* flavors.”

![Thanksgiving at Samin's host parents'][33]

In that clip you may have noticed how dull looking most of the foods on the Thanksgiving table are — compared to the brown turkey, white mashed potatoes, and off-yellow biscuits, the cranberry sauce uniquely stands out. And I think this is incredibly telling, because back in the visual world, the element which brightens screens, creates contrast, and balances a design is clear — it’s color.

![Color][34]

And when I say color, I primarily mean it in the standard sense, but I'm also talking about light more generally, in its full range of hue, saturation, and brightness. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that the most acidic foods in the world – think about citrus fruits or hot peppers – are also the most colorful. 

![Bringing balance to the screen][35]

Color’s strength, when taken by itself, lies in engaging our eyes, but maybe its more important job is not simply to engage us, but to act as a counterpoint to the other elements, space and type. When we think about the word balance, we might think that it means something more like evenness or equality of the elements on a screen, but it really has the closest relationship to what we call contrast. Consider the most well-known representation of balance, the yin yang symbol, which is essentially pure contrast.

Without acid, and without color, other elements have a tendency to blend together. In a dish that utilizes acid effectively, the flavors are able to stand on their own, they don't get lost in each other. When you take a bite, you can clearly distinguish the different parts of the dish and appreciate them separately. Color can do the same job of providing contrast in a display, especially when space is limited.

![Making it pop][36]

Consider how much easier it is to see focus your attention just on the signals and the arrows in this design, compared to the original, which lacks contrast.

![Layering and separation][37]

Or how the red commentary of the calligraphic instruction here creates a distinct layer which maintains its own coherence, and contrasts with the expressive black lines without disrupting them.

This is a beautiful display of information. But it wouldn’t be as effective if it weren’t used in a balanced, restrained way. Color, more than any other element of design, defines itself in relation to the other elements on the screen. No color exists in isolation, and the amounts and proportions that we use have to be chosen based on everything else we can see. Think of it like a glass of lemonade — a bit of lemon juice in a glass of water can be fine, but if we just squeezed two or three lemons into the same glass, it would be undrinkable. But add some sugar, and suddenly you have something refreshing and delicious. The water is no less acidic than it was before, but now the proportions are right to allow the acid to do its job of providing contrast without being overwhelming.

![The relativity of color][38]

And color is not only relative to other elements on the screen, it also appears completely differently depending on its environment, how it was produced, what the lighting of the room is like or the quality of the projector.

Here you can see how frustrating this can be when trying to select the right one, with each of my monitors displaying a completely different shade of green.

When selecting our acids, we can run into these same problems. It turns out that fruits get less acidic the further it grows from the equator, and even on the same tree, o the same grove, two different fruits can have completely different levels of acidity. A lime which grew higher up on the tree will be sweeter than a lime you can reach from the ground.

![Knowing when it's right][39]

If this sounds vague and unhelpful that’s because it kind of is, and that’s intentional. The only way to really know whether something is unbalanced is to test it. If you’re a chef you have to test by tasting, and in design we have to test by seeing. And not just seeing when we’re doing the work of designing, but seeing in the real world as well, where it will actually be used. When cooking, the only real test is how it tastes when the plate hits the table – it doesn’t matter that it may have been perfect 10 minutes ago as it was sitting under the heat lamp waiting to come out. Similarly, things that appear with subtle, beautiful contrast on our nice monitors here at Epic, may appear in kind of brutal starkness on a cheap monitor at a hospital, or even worse, may not appear at all.

![Using content as color][40]

But for some actual practical advice, as in cooking, I will say this: the best sources of brightness, contrast, and balance in design are natural ones. Think of some of the most engaging interfaces — Instagram, Spotify, or Netflix — they are all full of naturally occurring color. The interfaces themselves are usually very restrained, with lots of muted colors or gradations of black and white, but they can afford to be, because they’re made vibrant by the content they contain. Instagram is full of user-provided full-color photos, Spotify shows off beautiful album art, and Netflix is almost purely photos and videos. When you source your color wisely, you won’t feel the need to inject it into your screens artificially. In our own designs, some of these natural sources of color are patient photos, medical imaging, document scans, or data visualizations. Learn to use them, where appropriate, as opportunities for balancing space and type, and you’ll find that they provide much-needed contrast in a potentially dull display.

![Wrap-up: acid and color][41]

And so, finally, we come to...

![Heat][42]

Heat is different than the other elements that you need to be familiar with. Unlike salt, fat, or acid, heat is less of a thing and more of a relationship, or a property of things.

You cannot reach out and touch heat, you can only touch something that is hot. You can’t feel heat itself, you can only feel its effects. But those effects are transformational to good cooking. Heat takes food from raw to cooked, flabby to firm, pale to golden brown. We can hear it and we can see it in the sizzles, splatters, and crackles of the kitchen. The word cooking itself is both part and whole, as we use the word to mean simply making something hot, but also to refer to the process of culinary creation more generally.

In design, we’ve long understood that the relationships between elements is as important as the elements themselves, and that the whole is more than the sum of its parts. We refer to this quality by many names: today I’m just going to call it…

![Structure][43]

Structure.

We might also call it pattern, or Gestalt, after the early 20th century group of philosophers and psychologists who studied these kinds of relationships and their effects on human perception.

The basic thesis of Gestalt Psychology is that we actively construct our experience, and as we do, we tend to order it in such a way that the whole is as simple as possible. Our eyes are trained to see ordered, regular structure wherever they can, even to the point of seeing patterns that don’t exist, like faces in static.

![Gestalt principles][44]

As chefs use heat to transform their food, we can use this tendency toward structure to transform our designs. Here are a number of patterns which have particularly strong transformative effects on our visual perception.

Proximity, similarity, enclosure, and connection tell us that things which are close together, look the same, are grouped together, or are linked, tend to be seen as related to each other. Closure tells us that we tend to try and fill in the details of things, that we see these four dots as plotting out a rectangle, not as four separate dots. And we are naturally attuned to finding symmetries in what we see.

These are some of, but not all, of the transformative tools that we have at our disposal, and we can use them purposefully to achieve the effects that we want in our designs, to show the relationships which we consider important.

![Too cold][45]

As an example of the transformative role of structure, this is a mockup I made a while ago for case management, but with a lot of the structural elements removed.

You can see how all of the other elements are mostly there – the typographic hierarchy is good, everything has enough room to breathe, it’s got a healthy dose of meaningful color – and yet this is obviously terrible, right? It’s missing any patterns which our eyes could use to interpret what they’re seeing.

![Just right][46]

Add that structure back in, and suddenly it all makes sense. The case information on the left can be seen as a single unit, and the individual encounters in the history on the right can easily be parsed.

But as just a few minutes can mean the difference between cooked and overdone, so it’s easy to go too far with adding structure to a screen.

![Too hot][47]

This is an overdone UI. And this is obviously a kind of extreme example, but we do see more realistic examples of things like this a lot, where we might think that every potential relationship we want users to see on the screen needs to be explicitly built in.

The goal should be to provide just enough structure that the important relationships come through, and no more. And this involves looking at the big picture, not at the individual components.

![Reality over theory][48]

In the kitchen, it doesn’t matter if the recipe says to roast your chicken at 400 degrees for an hour if that chicken turns out to be a charred mess. We get no flavor points for following instructions if those instructions don’t reflect the realities of our situation.

The last video clip I’m going to show you is an example of thinking with your eyes and not your head.

![The food and not the fire][49]

> “At first, the kitchen intimidated me. The numbers on the oven dials had worn away, and people cooked on a giant hearth over an open fire. That just seemed crazy. It took me some time to learn to pay attention to the food and not the fire, and to use my senses, to look, listen, smell, taste. To master the final element in good cooking: heat.”

![Wrap-up: heat and structure][50]

Heat and structure are the elements we use to transform what we create. But their intangibility requires us to pay attention to the effects they have on what we’re making, and think in terms of relationships, not in terms of things.

![Craft][51]

Now that we’ve covered what I believe to be the foundational elements of our work, I want to end with some thoughts on craft. And I already talked a little bit about craft at the beginning of this talk, at least in one sense of the word – that is, craft meaning any activity which involves making things by hand. In this sense, both cooking and visual design are crafts. The visual artifacts we create here, among other things, include websites, application screens, documentation, posters and prints, UGM maps, and more. 

But another sense of the word craft, and maybe the more important one, is this second meaning: “skill in carrying out one’s work.”

Developing your craft, in this sense, requires much more than simply knowing what the things are that you have to know. Anyone who watches a lot of basketball can probably tell you the qualities which set a star athlete apart from a novice, but that doesn’t mean that that person should be included in the next NBA draft.

So obviously knowledge is not a sufficient component of craft, and sometimes, not even necessary.

![I well remember an occasion][52]

Cyril Stanley Smith was a British metallurgist who worked on the Manhattan project. I think this quote is one of the most perceptive I’ve ever read about the difference between knowing and understanding. I’ll give you a minute to read it.

![Balance, process, and technique][53]

As best I can tell, craft lies at the intersection of a sense of balance, the application of process, and knowledge of technique. And to the extent that someone has an intuitive understanding of these three qualities, so do they reveal an understanding of their craft.

Though Samin Nosrat has based a whole framework of good cooking around the fundamentals of Salt, Fat, Acid, and Heat, she recognizes that these elements are necessary, but are not in themselves sufficient. Of course it’s not as simple, as saying, “hey, next time you’re cooking, make sure that your meal has a type of fat, a bunch of salt, some acid, and then warm it up.” That would miss the point.

In her discussion of each element, these three requirements of their use keep coming up again and again – balance, process, and technique.

![Balance][54]

**Balance**, or proportion, means recognizing that everything has a sweet spot, that it is possible to have both too much, or too little, of any element. Overcook your steak and you’ll be chewing on it until the next day, undercook it and you might make yourself sick. Too much color can make a screen sickly and vibrant, not enough, and our eyes will crave excitement.

![Process][55]

**Process** means applying the elements at the right time, in the right order. This is what Samin calls layering  - working in each element at each stage of the creation of a dish, from salting the water for your pasta, incorporating salt into the sauce in the form of parmesan, and finally, maybe 7 grains of flaky finishing salt for texture. Every step of the way, we are thinking about how best to use each element, and how much, working backwards from the result we want to decide how best to get there from where we are. In our designs, it’s also important to think procedurally – what’s most important to focus on now, so that I don’t need to totally throw this thing out later? How can I focus on the big and forgiving parts first, so the end is about final touches and not open questions?

![Technique][56]

**Technique** means that all the balance and process in the world are worthless if you lack the basic skills to carry out your vision. More than any other aspect of craft, technique simply requires experience and focused practice. If you have to dice 100 onions every day, by the end of the year you’re going to get pretty good at dicing onions. For us, technique is not as straightforward as physical crafts, because we have computers to execute our vision, and computers always do exactly as they’re told. I don’t have to manually draw a bunch of sloppy rectangles on the screen every time I need a bar graph. But that doesn’t mean technique is not involved – it helps to know, for example, when to use flexbox, floats, or grids for layout. Or the pros and cons of using PNGs or SVGs for icons.

![Through the gate][57]

I don’t think I could give a talk without a good architecture quote.

As we become familiar with our four elements of good design, and learn to develop the craft of applying them, we find that eventually, the elements become secondary to the patterns of their use, and the relationships between them. But on the road to understanding, it helps to have knowledge.

![Cooking and design][58]

If there’s one thing I hope you take away from this talk, it’s this: As Salt, Fat, Acid, and Heat form the basis of all good cooking, Space, Type, Color, and Structure form the basis of any beautiful design. If you develop a relationship with these four essential elements, and learn to understand not just *how* they are used, but *why* they are used, and the role they play in the products we create, then you too can create delicious user interfaces, even without a mockup.
